Certainly! I'll explain each line of the SQL script:

1. `CREATE TABLE employee (`: This line starts the creation of a table named "employee".

2. `emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,`: This line defines the "emp_id" column as an integer and sets it as the primary key of the table.

3. `first_name VARCHAR(40),`: This line defines the "first_name" column as a variable character string with a maximum length of 40 characters.

4. `last_name VARCHAR(40),`: This line defines the "last_name" column similar to the "first_name" column.

5. `birth_day DATE,`: This line defines the "birth_day" column as a date data type.

6. `sex VARCHAR(1),`: This line defines the "sex" column as a variable character string with a maximum length of 1 character.

7. `salary INT,`: This line defines the "salary" column as an integer.

8. `super_id INT,`: This line defines the "super_id" column as an integer, which likely represents the ID of the employee's supervisor.

9. `branch_id INT`: This line defines the "branch_id" column as an integer, which likely represents the ID of the branch where the employee works.

10. `);`: This line ends the definition of the "employee" table.

The subsequent lines in the script follow a similar pattern to create the "branch", "client", "works_with", and "branch_supplier" tables, each with their respective columns and data types.

The `INSERT INTO` statements populate the tables with sample data, providing some initial records for the tables.

Finally, the `SELECT` statements retrieve data from the tables. Each `SELECT` statement queries the database to retrieve specific information, such as all employees, all clients, or employees meeting certain criteria.

The comments added in the script aim to explain the purpose of each line or group of lines, providing clarity on what each part of the script accomplishes.
